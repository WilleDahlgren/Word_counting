# Word_counting
This code is from a lab a partner and I did in an introductory course in python. The program counts the occurrence of all words in a textfile. The programs accepts textfiles in a format that is local to your computer, meaning you have it as a file on your harddrive or in a URL format, the url must lead to a textfile for it to work).
