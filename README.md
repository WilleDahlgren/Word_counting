# Word_counting
This code is from a lab a partner and I did in an introductory course in python. The program counts the occurrence of all words in a textfile. 
The program accepts textfiles in a format that is local to your computer, meaning you have it as a file on your harddrive or in a URL format, the URL must lead to a textfile for it to work. 

The program works by entering 3 argument in the terminal. 
The first argument is a textfile with words you don't want to be counted. 
The second argument is the textfile in a form mentioned previously.
The third argument tells the computer to print out the top n most used words. Determines the length of the word tally.
